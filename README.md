# About
This is the final project of [CSE 257](https://scungao.github.io/ucsd-s21/cse257s21.pdf) at UCSD. I reproduce the main results of the [SGM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06417) and conduct serveral extensions to it. [Scottemmons's repo](https://github.com/scottemmons/sgm) helps me a lot when implementing the SGM algorithm.
